# The Void

I remembered being here before with Dev. My head felt better. I still felt like I was a failure. But I wasn’t hearing that chant. Dev turned me quickly around, “You okay?”

“I’m fine.” I smiled to reassure him.

“Who the fuck was that? And what he was doing in your dream?”

“A vampire - Virgil Salazar. A dream walker.” I sighed. “Dev I need to go back in there. And I need you to get Ant and he needs to find the dream walker so we can kill him. He can’t move if he’s bothering me.”

“Nox. If you go back in there he’ll do whatever it was he was doing.”

I nodded. “I know, Dev. But he’s a dream walker, he can move from body to body, he has for centuries. I need you to do this. Please.” I begged.

“Okay, but answer me first. Why did you leave the room?”

“I was feeling everything you described and I had to leave.”

Dev sighed. “I’m sorry I vocalized your feelings. I didn’t know it would make it worse.”

I shrugged. “It’s okay. You didn’t make it worse. Once you and Sage started fighting I couldn’t handle it anymore. I was starting to spiral.”

“And that’s how he got his hooks in you?”

I nodded. “Yeah. Dev. I’ll be okay. We have to do this together. Make sure Sage and Dee are there to ground me. The kids too. Even Morana. She’ll help with my connection to Ant.”

Dev pulled me close. “Pretty boy, you aren’t worthless. I love you.”

I kissed him. “I love you. I’m not worthless. With Sage and Dee out there with me I’ll keep believing it even as he bombards me with it. Dev, I need you to trust me.”

Dev sighed. “I trust you Nox. I just don’t want you to get hurt. This is like what the demon did. I…”

I kissed Dev again to shut him up. It was soft and tender but grew into something more. “I love you Dev. I have you to pull me out of my head. I trust you. Trust me.”

Dev nodded. “I’ll be back as soon as I talk to Ant.” He didn’t wait any longer while he pushed me back into my colorful world.
