# Under the Tree

Sage was curled up around my pillow when I walked into the bedroom.  Dee curled around him and I sighed.  She patted the space next to her.  "I want to be by Sage.  You and Dev drift off into dream world without us.  At least I can feel his warmth.

I sighed.  "Fine."  I went back downstairs.

Sage growled, "Come to bed, Nox."

He patted the spot in front of him.  I laid down with him and he wrapped his arms around me.  Dee moved back to the other side of the king size bed and dragged Sage back with her.  "This works she muttered.  Dev can sleep with you.  If you don't freak out."

I growled at the implication that I had fits over little things.  Sage rolled on to his back and kissed Dee.  "Leave him alone."

I sighed.  "It's alright love."

He pullled me close.  "Night Nox.  Love you."

"Love you."

Dee giggled.  "Love you two."

"We love you too."  I said and closed my eyes.

I fell asleep and dreamed of my barren tree.  I always dreamed of the barren tree.  It flickered with images and the grass around it was lush and green.  No more plowed feilds.  It was better than the nightmare.  I ran my fingers over the bark and the tree shuddered under my touch, the eyes opened and they were a little creepy.

Dev laughed behind me, "I'll never get used to that."

"I know.  It's weird."

Dev pulled me down on the blanket that was at the base of the tree.  It was always the same red and white checkerboard pattern like we were going on a picnic.  "It's creepy."  Dev said, "But the weird thing is, they only do that when you touch it."  He wrapped his arms around me and smiled.  "Your date didn't go well did it?"

I shook my head.  "Did you think it would?"

"Not with your mood and Dee's problems."

I sighed.  "I'm sorry I hurt you because I don't let you in.  I won't do it anymore.  But I ..."

Dev pressed a finger to my lips. "I get you do it for Dee.  She is still in denial.  She doesn't want to be an empath."

I sighed.  "Are you with us?"

"Curled up next to you, prety boy."

"Good."

Dev started singing, "If I had my way, / I'd spend every day right by your side / And if I could stop time,
Believe me I'd try for you and I / And each moment you're gone, / Is a moment too long in my life / So stay right here, right now."  He hugged me tight and we drifted.  This was the only time that my life actually made sense.  When I was asleep...
