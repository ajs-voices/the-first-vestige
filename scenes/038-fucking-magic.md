# Fucking Magic

We followed Gemma into her house.  I think I expected feathers and dead things and all sorts of black magic artifacts.  What I found was normal ordinary things.  No sign this woman was a wicca nor that she was high preistess of her coven.  I was still reeling from the shit storm that had become my life.  Ascendant, prophecy, fucking regnans... With all this destiny and fate and prophecy bullshit hanging over me all I wanted to do was rebel to prove to the world I wasn't that person.  I wasn't controlled I wasn't ruled.

But as I sat and listened to the senora tell me how my powers worked.  I didn't even have any fucking clue what the fuck she was talking about.  I had to center myself.  Control my emotions, fucking get out of my head.  Like that was ever going to happen.  I needed to harness the power, and learn to weild it properly.  Thing was I didn't feel anything to control.  There was no raging cesspool of magic.  There was just me.

Gemma went on and on until Ant had to leave because daylight came and he had to be home there were no shadows here to walk from.  And while he'd not burst into flames, he didn't like walking in the sun.  Ryan stayed with me.  Ant took Isabel with him to get aquainted with the method of travel and to find a room of her comfort level.

I was lost in all the magic.  But Gemma smiled at me, "The sun is up.  The day is long.  Sleep."  She touched my temple and the next thing I knew I was standing under my barren tree.  The night sky was shimmering in the daylight.  The patterns in the stars moved with the currents of my mind.  My life played across the sky in the stars.  Some images stayed.  Images like a babe wrapped in swaddled blanket.  A boy juggling balls of the elements.  Every important moment in my life etched into the fabric of the night sky.  And when it all played out the images faded into stars and the stars into moments of time that I could touch and call upon.

Each moment building until the sky was full of shining stars.  The constellations were foreign - like nothing I'd ever seen.  I'd glimpsed them before, some I could see with ease.  The howling wolf, a flickering flame, a bleeding heart.  Some were there I could almost make them out.

I glanced back at my tree and saw my lover standing there.  He was watching me.  The tree above him had tiny green buds and then were gone.  He smiled at me and I grinned back.  He beckoned me with a single finger and I drew near.  I didn't walk but it wasn't quite floating I was just closer.  "I didn't think you'd be here tonight since you'd seen us already."

I smiled.  "I didn't plan on it.  I think my new wiccan friend is showing me something.  Though I'm not sure what it is."

Dev laughed. "Oh pretty boy."  He pulled me close to kiss and I lost all interest in the world around me and the world outside this dream.  I had Dev and he wasn't mad at me.  My other lovers were...

I sighed and Dev shook his head.  "They'll be fine Nox.  Just find what's missing."

"I know what's missing.  Danger, excitement, my life.  Knowing I was making a difference."  I said knowing that none of that would make Dev happy.  I knew what made me happy.  Drake had said it, 'saving people is what you do.'  And for too long I was trying to hide in the real world.  I couldn't be that person anymore than Sage could stop hacking things.  I knew he wasn't straight up legal like his father said he was.  There was no way possible the Wicked Truth was straight as an arrow.  And Adam...

Dev sighed.  "You think too much."

"I'm sorry Dev."

"No, I get it."  Dev smirked at me.  "I'm just a figment of your imagination and I'm easily forgotten about."  There was a fake frown on my beautiful blue eyed rockstar.  His icey blue eyes shining in amusement while he waited for me.

I bit my bottom lip which made the grin lopsided.  He pressed his lips to mine and I was lost to him.  He was my best distraction.

I ended up pressed against the tree trunk and our clothes scattered on the roots while Dev and I melded into one.  In the dream it was perfect.  It was always perfect.  His hands on my skin.  His scent all around me.  The sun came out and obscured the stars, but the stars grew brighter the closer I came to my release.  The earth rippled in my pleasure.  "Oh Fuck, Dev."  I shouted and it echoed in my head, but my dream voice was carried away on the winds that blew softly through as we came down.

A hand on my shoulder jolted me awake.  "Fuck!"  I groaned.
