# Getting Ready

Sage pulled me off the couch.  "Go get ready."

I sighed.  It wasn't that I didn't want to go.  Ever since Dev left I felt worse.  To kill time I went to NYU's website and looked at all the courses they were offering.  But the semester had already started so I could apply but it wouldn't help my boredom now.  I didn't even have any fucking clue what I wanted to do.

Both Sage and Dev were trying to help me find a path to go.  Dev tried to talk me into bartending at Aspect.  Sage pushed me to teach a class at the gym.  And I had I said I'd try both, but they didn't have places for me so again I waited.

Sage sighed.  "Come on Nox."

"I'm moving."  I said.

"You could be happy about it."

"I'm happy."  I said with a faked grin.

Sage rolled his eyes.  "Dee has a good night planned.  I know we are busy but you'll get used to this.  I promise.  Go have fun.  Forget your mundane life."  He said mundane with hatred.  That was the only thing he didn't like - the fact that this life bored the living fuck out of me.  He was happy I was here all the time.  He was happy I lived with him.  That I cooked for him.  I cleaned for him.  He was in heaven and I lived a boring mundane life.  I felt like shit and no amount of yoga or working out fixed it.  I really should go see Adrian.  Or Margo...  You know it's bad when I am almost to that point.

I went upstairs and took a shower and pulled on a pair of blue jeans, a non-sarcastic t-shirt - actually it was one of Sage's.  It still smelled like him and it was comforting when I felt like shit.  I wore a black button down over top the black t-shirt with the Avengers written across the chest.

My hair was colored orange and my nails matched.  I think redid my nails everyday out of sheer boredom.  My hair too.  I applied make up everyday, maybe not as thick as I did today but there were parts of me that stuck to my habits.  I scratched at the modified tattoo.  You couldn't see the cross swords anymore.  It was a chinesse symbol that meant exiled.  Very blatent for the Venatori.

I didn't have nightmares anymore at least not like I used to.  My other fears were replaying in my head - the tattoo had me in sweats for a few nights afterwards.  But I don't think it had anything at all to do with the actual tattoo more what it represented.  My fear of change.  I couldn't even jump from the AU building.  They wouldn't let me past the Infirmary.  My whole fucking life was changed the day I said fuck you to the Venatori.

And I have no one to blame but myself.

I pulled on my leather jacket and headed back downstairs to say night to the boys and Sage.  They had pizza for dinner.  No telling what I was having since no one would tell me anything.  No one really understood the anxiety not knowing caused me.  But what did it really matter.  I was a ball of nerves anyway.
