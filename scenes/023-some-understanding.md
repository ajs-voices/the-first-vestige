# Some Understanding

I walked out the door but before I closed it my little dragon stopped me.  "Daddy?"  His voice was broken with sleep and he was yawning.

I closed the door and turned around to see Sage had fled down stairs to his private sanctuary.  I looked up the stairs and my little dragon was sitting on the top step.  "Are you coming back?"

"Always."  I said softly.

"But what if you die like Mommy and my old Daddy?"

I climbed up the stairs and and sat against the wall a few stairs below Drake so I could look level into his orange eyes.  "Then Sage, or Kai will look after you."

My little dragon launched into my arms and it was everything I could do to stop us from both tumbling down the stairs.  "I don't want you to die."

"I don't want to die either.  But I don't have any intentions of dying soon."  I smiled at him as I pulled him tight against me.

"Daddy?"  Drake whispered and gazed lovingly up at me.  "Is Vader done with us too?"

I hugged him tight, "No baby, he's not.  He's mad at me."

"But you are going to save people."  Drake pulled away and looked down the stairs.  "Like you saved me, and Fae."  He put his hands on my shoulders and stood up so he could look in my eyes better one leg bent on the stair above us and the other on the step below.  "You save them.  That's what you do.  Vader will understand."

How could my three-year-old little dragon understand and Sage not?  I smiled at him while I fought back the tears threatening to slide down my cheeks.  "I hope so.  But you need to be in bed."

Drake pressed a kiss to my cheek and hopped up to the top of the stairs and looked down.  "Daddy?"

I looked up at him with a smile, "Hmmmm?"

"Call me while you are gone."

I nodded.  "Of course, Drake.  I'll call all of you. I love you."

His orange eyes lit up as he smiled down at me.  "Wuv you."

The little dragon scurried to his room quietly and I assumed he crawled into his bed without waking Fae as no one came out.  I finished my exit and the moment I was out the door I felt the tears sliding down.
