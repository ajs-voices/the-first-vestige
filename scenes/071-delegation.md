# Delegation

Bernstein was going to go through other channels. I had my own to go through, magical ones. There were still plenty of vampire powers to rule out. I knew what Desmond felt like. And I knew that the Night Life building was teaming with new Vampire powers. I knew Armand. I could feel him inside me. The flower on my knee itched and scratched at it. Apparently thoughts activated the flowers too. I sighed. This was going to take a while to get used to.

I sent my power out again to find the differing powers. Hell’s Kitchen felt like wolf with a mixture of Dragon. I didn’t know the areas farther away from New York. I needed to be mobile, I couldn’t go trapsing around New York with a pack of deadly creatures following me.

I looked at Ant and he growled, “Don’t even think about asking.”

I smirked at him, “Wouldn’t dream of it.”

I looked at Ryan and Cari. “You two can check with Armand, see if he knows anything?”

Cari rolled her eyes, “He’s afraid of speaking with me.”

“So send just Ryan. Walker could go with him. Armand saw me with him before. He’d trust him a little more with Ryan around.”

Walker shook his head. “I’m not going anywhere with him.”

“Why not?” I asked.

“He’s a human servant. He’ll kill me.”

“Why would he kill you? You are an ally?”

Walker looked at the other blonde with a frown. “I don’t think that’s a good idea Nox.”

“You wanted to see how I did things right? The other way?”

He sighed. “That was before.”

I interrupted, “Before what? Before I exiled myself? Left the one the only thing I knew because I was tired of being played?”

Walker shook his head. “They say they threw you out for your views.”

I laughed. “They would.” I shook my head. “Whatever.” I looked at Ryan, “Can you talk to Armand alone?”

He nodded. “Yeah, boss. I can. Soon as I make sure Cari gets back to the Night Life building.”

“Of course.”

She looked at me. “I don’t need a bodyguard Ryan. Do your job. I will watch your family like it is my own.”

I smiled and bowed. “I appreciate it.”

Kai stepped forward, “I can go with Ryan, Nox. I’d like to meet this vampire that helped you with the Dragon problem.”

I smiled. “Don’t kill Armand, please. He might push your buttons.”

Ant laughed. “No he will push your buttons.”

Kai nodded. “Understood.” My father put his hand on my arm, “Stay safe son.”

“Always.”

Kai shook his head. “It wasn’t always so.”

“I didn’t have anyone that cared Kai.”

“Dorian and Dae’lin did.” Kai said.

“No they didn’t. They’d know I was gone, but I wasn’t that cemented in their life to be more than a passing glance. I have three boys counting on me to come home and three who love me too.”

“You have more than that.” Kai said. “Take care son.” He wasn’t going to say he loved me, anymore than I would tell him I loved him. I wasn’t even sure I did. But I cared if he lived or died. It would break my heart to see the boys lose him. And that was more than i could say about my mother.

Emilio put his hand on my shoulder, “I go where he goes.” I know and nodded. The three of them could handle Armand. And Emilio could handle my father - he had for years.

I looked around at the rest of the people standing around. “Go home. Your respective contingents will be contacted if and when I need back up.”

I didn’t wait for anyone to say anything as I started down the tunnels towards the next junction to the topside. I needed to in scenery that I recognized.
