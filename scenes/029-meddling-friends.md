# Meddling Friends

The four of us chatted.  They mostly did.  I was too preoccupied with my own thoughts to pay much attention to what was going down with the human servants of Il Cane.  I was having a moment of holy fuck.  I was really doing this.  Night had fallen an hour ago and Ant hadn't found me yet.  But when I thought to find him he opened the door with a grin on his face like he was proud of himself.

Ant crooked his index finger at me and I waved at the others.  "See you guys later."

Allison giggled.  "You guys.  I guess it's better than Jack's ya'll."

"Hey."  Jack said in mock offense.  "I resemble that remark."

Ant drapped an arm over my shoulder.  "I got something for you."

He pulled a Beratta M9 out of a shadow pocket and handed it to me.  "I figured you'd prefer Damnation over something Allison had picked out for you."

"You went to Sage's house?"

He nodded.  "Yeah.  Sage was downstairs with his brother.  Matt was feeding the boys when I came downstairs with your things.  I just grabbed the bugout bag the rest is still there."  He frowned.  Which wasn't a good look on his handsome face.

"What?"

"Drake wouldn't let me leave with your things."  Ant said.

"And?"

He sighed.  "Only way I could leave was to bring them with me.  They all pulled out bug out bags and were ready faster than I could tell Sage what was going on.  He was busy with his brother so he just shrugged at me.  Tell Dee where they are going, was all he managed."

I sighed.  Fuck!  "Where are they?"

"I put them in a suite upstairs.  They each have their own room, and the living room and kitchen shared.  They are in heaven.  Matt said he'd take care of them all.  And I have Larry going to see Dee at work to give her a key and the code so she can check on the boys.  Mom's here.  Ryan will look in on them too.  So will Allison.  They'll be safer here than with Sage.  Just in case.  I'd move Sage here if I thought he'd come.  You don't mind?"

I shrugged.  "As long as they are safe.  Where are my things?"

Ant smiled.  "In my apartment.  We leave in 20."

He opened the door to his apartment and then left back down the hall.  "Last minute instructions from Mom.  I'll be back and we can go."

"Alright."
