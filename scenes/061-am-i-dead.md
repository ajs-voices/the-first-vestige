# Am I Dead?

There was darkness everywhere. Pain was at the distance peripheral and then that too became mind numbingly dull. Until everything was just darkness. There was this sense of loss. A sense of fear and anger and hate. Oblivion set in and the world around me started to shift. Color faded in like a rising sun. I found myself standing underneath a tree on fire.

I knew the three. I had dreamt about this tree nearly every night since I’d woken from my nightmares. But it had never been on fire. I grasped for my power but it slipped from my fingers. I could feel it, I touched it. But it pulled away from me. It gave me the distinct feeling that it was busy. I couldn’t interrupt it.

I stood staring at my tree burning. The other images flickered around me. Blood oozed from the trunk of the tree. I bent down to touch it and it recoiled from my touch. No, it was pulled back into the tree. I reached for it again and it didn’t move, my fingers came away sticky with cooling blood.

The grass around me was green. I saw flowers in the distance. The sky was still the same, the stars were crisper. The constellations like nothing I’d ever seen in the night sky before. But the tree burnt. Sorrow and pain shifted around my senses and I looked in the direction of the feeling. I drifted that direction. Lying on the ground I saw a body burning. Ant and Ryan knelt beside it. A trail of blood ran down Ant’s cheek. I knew I wasn’t there. Hell I didn’t even know what I saw was real.

Their mouths moved. But I heard no sound. And my lip reading skills sucked. Ant looked up at me and cocked his head to the side curiously. Did he see me? I waved my hands and he looked away and into the direction of the rising sun. He used magic and scooped up the smoldering corpse. Everyone disappeared and I was back in my little piece of dream world.

At the base of the tree a dragon statue flickered where the blood had coalesced before, now the dragon curled around itself. I touched it and felt the pure joy of swinging high into the sky. I don’t know why I felt that, It felt like jumping. I turned and saw my little dragon swinging high into the sky. Matt was behind him pushing him. The boys were giggling and laughing. Fae sat in the background with a book. Matt looked in my direction and frowned. He pulled out his phone and glanced at it before pushing Drake again.

The tiny Dragon laughed and flew high into the sky and I was back in my world. I sighed. I didn’t know what was going on, but I had a feeling my life was flashing before my eyes. I was dying. Fuck!
