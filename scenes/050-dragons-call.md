# Dragon Call

I pulled out my phone and I dialed Margo’s number without opening up my contacts. It probably wasn’t even there to begin with. Though knowing Sage it was. But I knew it by heart. It hadn’t changed in the years I’d known her.

I hadn’t been to a therapy session with Dr. Margo Silverman in months. Ever since I found out she’d been lying to me my whole life and killed my twin sister - I never really forgave her for that. I thought about all the other people I’d forgiven over the years. The only one who I forgave out of the gate had been Dorian. He’d lied to me on many occasion. But not because he wanted to - but someone else had told him to keep quiet. I couldn’t fault him for those reasons, and they weren’t his secrets to tell necessarily.

Megan picked up the phone. “Dr. Silverman’s office, can I help you?”M

My heart was in my throat and I almost hung up the phone, but I took a deep breath and spoke, “Hey Megan, how’s Greta?”

“Nox!” Megan cried enthusiastically. “I’m surprised to hear from you with your Exile and all.”

“I’m not calling about therapy. I need to talk with Margo about something else. It’s important. Like life and death important so I need her to call me back as soon as she can.”

Megan poked on her computer and then I heard a flip of a button. “Dr. Silverman, I have a call for you on line one.” She turned back to me on the phone line, “She can take your call now. There is no one here for another 15 minutes.”

“Thank you, Megan. Kiss Greta for me.”

"Dr. Silverman. How can I help you?” Margo’s silvery voice echoed over the line while I tried to breath and keep my calm.

“Hey Margo.” I said finally.

“Nox?” Her voice sounded like she didn’t believe it was me. “What can I do for you? Is everything alright?”

I sighed. “I need to get in touch with Reginald.”

“Why do you need to get in touch with my father?” Margo asked.

“I have a need and he might be able to help get get that need.”

She sighed. “Nox I need more information. My father won’t like me giving Venatori his number.”

“I know. But one, I’m not Venatori anymore, and I really can’t say over the phone. I’m in Italy right now and I need some assistance.”

“My father can’t help you in Italy.”

“No but he can get me in touch with someone who can.” I said.

“Nox, this is highly unusual.” She sighed. “This your phone number?”

“Yes ma’am.”

“Nox, I will have my father call you. But I can’t make any promises.”

“I know. Please, it’s important.”

“I’ll try, Nox. Are you alright?”

“I’m fine.”

She chuckled. “That’s not what I hear.”

“I’m not going to get into it Margo. I need to keep people safe. So I need Reginald’s help. Thanks, for your help Margo.” I hung up the phone and went about things. Ryan was watching me. He was the only one that had followed me out of the room.

He grinned at me. “Everyone said I should stay with you.”

“I don’t need a body guard.” I said.

Ryan laughed. “I think the vampires think you need a servant, an assistant something, and since I’m just human, I’m here.”

I rolled my eyes. “What do you want to be doing?” I asked.

“I don’t know. Normally I’d be Cari’s shadow, but she’s not here. And I’m here to protect you and help Ant. I might as well follow you around like I would Cari.”

“You don’t mind being a human servant to a vampire?”

“Cari’s not a hard master despite what people thing. Sure I have a chaotic mess in my head all the time. And a psychopath for a master but I like to think Cari is a better person because of me and Mia. I mean I think I did a pretty good job helping to raise Ant.”

“He’s a good man.” I said. 

Ryan laughed. “He’s not a good man. He’s like his mother just more controlled. Piss off Ant and the Prince’s wrath is just as furious as Il Cane’s, if not worse. 

“Good is relative.” I sighed. “I’m not a good man by human standards either. I’ve killed people.”

“But you save more.” Ryan interrupted.

“And Ant doesn’t?”

“Yeah, but…”

I shrugged. “Good is relative in our world. We do more good than harm. Il Cane is a force of good no matter how blood thirsty she is. I know the legend of her hunger. Everyone fucks up. She corrected it. She had good people helping her.”

I shook my head. This was my life. I knew Sage was going to be pissed, but this was what I needed to do. I wouldn’t rush into danger. I could manage that, but this is what I did.
