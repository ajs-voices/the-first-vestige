# My Rockstar

The sun would go down in a few hours and we'd travel to Madrid, Spain where I'd meet Aurora Dejesus - the master of the vampire who Igor was certain was the mole.  So I crashed in my room.  On my bed which was feather soft and I pulled my phone to my ear and dialed Dev.  I hoped he wasn't too angry with me.  I wasn't sure I could handle it.

Dev answered with a sigh of relief, "I was worried."

"I know.  I'm sorry.  I should have called sooner."

Dev chuckled.  "I was still sleeping honestly glad you didn't.  After you left I woke up and texted Dee but no one knew anything.  I did the only thing I could, I went back to bed so when you did call I wasn't a dead man."

"You knew I'd call?"

Dev sighed, "I'm surprised you didn't just send me a text."

"I'm not bad of a boyfriend am I?"  I sounded a little more defeated than I liked.

I could hear Dev's grin on the other side of the phone.  "I'm just glad you are alright.   You are alright, aren't you?"

"Perfect.  I got to do the stupid superhero landing, before a vampire started trying to mind fuck me.  I killed two others before going after more and got another two."

Dev had started laughing after I said superhero landing.  I don't think he heard any of the rest of it.  I asked, "What's so funny?"

"Do you realized what you just said?"

I gave an exaggerated sigh, "Yes, I've been hanging around you and Sage too much if that's what I'm thinking when there is danger afoot."

Dev giggled.  I loved when he giggled.  It wasn't a girly giggle, but that laugh that said he was more than happy and amused with his surroundings or company.  I groaned softly, "Fuck, Dev."

Dev's voice went a little deeper and a little raspier after that.  "Pretty boy, stop that now."

I groaned again at the command and he chuckled.  "That wasn't stopping."

"I'm sorry."  I apologized but I wasn't really sorry and Dev knew it.

"I should revoke sleeping privledges."

I started to protested but Dev interrupted.  "But that would be a bad idea I think.  You need at least one tie to home.  I'm not going anywhere pretty boy."

"Thank you lover.  God I love you."

Dev laughed.  "I think that's the first time you've said those three words to me without the others being around."

"Really?"  I asked.  I thought about it and shrugged.  "I should tell you more often then."

"I think you are just infatuated with the idea of me."  Dev said softly.  I didn't know if he was being serious or if it was a joke.

So I let it go as a joke.  "So I won't say it again then." I rolled my eyes even though I knew he couldn't see it, "Fine."  It got a chuckle from Dev but it was a little strained.

"I should get some sleep before night fall."  I said into the awkward silence.

"Night pretty boy."  Before he hung up I could have sworn I heard him whisper, "I love you too."  But the phone was dead and there was nothing but dead air on the other side.  It made me wonder if I'd imagined it in my head - wishful thinking.
