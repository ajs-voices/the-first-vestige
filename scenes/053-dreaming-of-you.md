# Dreaming of You

I made it to my bedroom and I crawled into bed. I heard Ryan standing guard on the other side. “Ry.” I called out.

He stuck his head in and I nodded, “Sleep. You can’t be awake all day either.”

He shook his head. “I’m Chevalier. I can manage.”

I smiled. “Please. I’d rather have you sharp. You can crash here with me. I promise I won’t take advantage of you.” I grinned at him.

“You aren’t going to let me say no are you?”

I shook my head. “Nope. It’s easier if you just say yes.”

He sighed and shut the door behind him and kicked his shoes off and climbed onto the rather large bed with me. He grinned, “At least you didn’t tell me to go to my own room.”

“I knew better than that.” I patted his hand as I rolled over and closed my eyes. “See you in a few hours.”

I drifted to sleep quickly once I relaxed into the feather mattress. The empty dream quickly coalesced into my barren tree and my rockstar stood under the tree looking at the three eyes in a triangle. “You are late.”

“I’m sorry.” I said as I wrapped my arms around him. “I had to deal with something and needed daylight hours.”

“Danny stopped by Sage’s yesterday. There has been a pack wide call to stay in a safe house. Sage told him to fuck off. But I convinced him to go stay with the boys. He only agreed because Dee said she’d be there too. Should I join them, Nox?”

I nodded. “I’d like it if you did.”

He smiled and I held out my arms and he walked to me and put his hands on his hips. “Do you want me safe? Or to keep the peace?” 

“Let me take care of you this once.”

He took another step crowding me, his body pressed against mine, his hands moved to my hips. “I think I can manage that this once.” He grinned at me and pressed a kiss. “And if you are nice I’ll try to bring them along tomorrow.”

“Nice how?” I grinned at him.

“I think I can think of a few things.” Dev said with a wicked smile.

“Ryan is in my bed with me.”

“Are you cheating on us?” Dev poked fun.

“He’s my body guard. I need him fresh at night, he can’t stand watch outside my door while I sleep. We won’t be here that long for him to grab a nap. This is just easier.” 

Dev laughed. “Uh huh. I’m sure, that’s just a good excuse.”

“How is Sage?” I asked.

“He misses the boys. He misses you but he won’t say so. He and Adam are busy but I think he realizes he was wrong. He’s thinking it anyway. Dee just wants everyone happy. She hates that no one is happy with you gone.”

“The boys?”

“The boys are good. Matt is really stepping it up with Fae and Drake. Dee is there with them, but Matt’s the one that gets them out the door. They don’t listen too well to Dee. I think they know that she’s mad at you.”

I laughed. “Of course they do.”

“But no one is talking. It’s like you left and everyone went back to keeping it all inside.”

I sighed and wrapped my arms around my rockstar, “Except you, who hears everything.” I pressed my forehead against his. “I’m sorry you have to deal with this alone.”

Dev laughed. “I’m not alone. I get to see you every night. Even if you were late.”

I grinned at Dev. “I’m sorry I was late.”

“It can’t be helped, I know you hate it. I’m just glad you made it.” Dev pressed a kiss to my lips. It was soft and tender, but it quickly grew into more as hands started to wander. This is how my life should be - always in the arms of the man I loved. Or the woman…
