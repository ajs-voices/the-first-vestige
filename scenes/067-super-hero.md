# Super Hero

Before we could leave, Sage called my name. “Wait, Nox.” I stopped on the other side of the door, Ged and Vincent between me and Sage. “You can’t leave looking like that.” 

“Like what?”

Dev giggled. “I think he means normal.”

Sage nodded and grinned at Dev. “This isn’t the super hero I met. I don’t know this guy.” He flashed me an eye liner pen. He stepped between my body guards and the door and they let him. He pulled the cap off the pen and looked at it. His hands were shaking a little. “You need to do the hair thing too.”

“The hair thing?” I asked grinning at him.

"The dyed tips.” I sighed. And I magiced the tips of my hair. It wasn’t great I knew it was going to require a little m ore work when I could look in the mirror. But I’d done it often enough I knew what I was doing without looking.

Sage grinned. “You can’t do the make up tho?”

I shook my head. “No. Not unless I want my nails permanently black and the eyeliner permanent.”

“You’d never have to do it again.”

I chuckled. “No. I’d rather not.” 

Sage handed me the pen and I moved to the picture on the wall and used the horrible reflection to apply the eye liner. Sage watched me. “At least you have an appropriate shirt.”

I hadn’t even looked at what Ryan had chosen when I put it on. I was in such a rush. I glanced down to see a red shirt saying “In my defense I was left unsupervised.”

“Allison or Ryan?” I looked at Ant

He shrugged. “Probably Ry. He likes your shirts.”

Sage smiled at me. He pushed me back down the hall away from the others. He pressed me against the wall and I felt that tiny bit of panic well up inside of me before he pressed a kiss to my lips. “I’m sorry.”

“About what?” I asked.

“Everything. I felt you die. I saw you in my office with Adam. I have things I want to tell you. But I know you have to do. I…” He stuttereed. “I’m sorry if I made this hard. I said it was over. I knew it was wrong the moment you left. But you were gone. Angry and I..” Sage sighed. “Nox, I don’t want to live without you even if that means you might die for real.”

My heart soared at the words. “What brought this around? I’m not complaining but you were so pissed at me.”

Sage grinned at me. “Last night, I had a dream. It put things in perspective." He pressed a kiss to my lips. “I’ll tell you about it when this is over. I love you Nox. Everything about you. I’m sorry I’m an ass lately. I’ll be better, do better to help you get your life on track. I didn’t understand.”

I grinned at him. “We’ll all work on it together, love. I’ll be back. I promise.”

Sage hugged me tight. “I know you will. My own personal superhero.” He let me go. “Too bad I have to share you with the rest of the world.”

Dev was standing in the doorway watching us. I grinned at him and he nodded. I don’t know what he did, but he just saved whatever relationship we had. I loved my dream walker as much as I loved my wicked truth. I hugged Sage one last time. “Take care of Dee. I think we have a lot of work ahead of us.”

He nodded. “I will.”

I was lighter as I walked into the elevator. Things were looking better. All it took was me dying. I hated the universe and it’s fucking destiny bullshit.
