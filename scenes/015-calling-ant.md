# Calling Ant

We walked to the entrance but I stopped at the bottom of the stairs.  Dee sighed and wrapped her arms around me and I hugged her shoulders to me while I leaned against the wall.  It was slightly romanic, but I was tense.  Vampires ripping through New York would be a bad thing.

Ant picked up, "Hey Nox.  It's been a while."

"No vampire business to deal with anymore.  Except there is."

Ant sighed.  "We already know your dad is hunting some of us.  I'm not having any luck myself.  My mother is coming to town to deal with it.  Some prince of the city I am."  He laughed.

"You do better than Desmond.  He has little control."

Ant grinned, "He's just a CCB lackey anyway.  He does what they say, not what the council says he should be doing."

"I know.  My dad wants help.  I told him I'd call."

"Where you at?  Mother says if she helps your father you have to help us.  She wants to meet you now."  Ant said with a little surprise in his voice.

"I'm in a subway outside of Dev and Dee's place.  But I'm busy right now."

Ant laughed, "Your boy can wait."

"Dev is at work.  I'm on a date with Dee."  I said.  Dee shifted against me and looked up at me with a smile.

"Mom won't wait."

I sighed.  "I'll meet her at the Night Life building in 20?"

Ant took a few moments to relay the message to his mother.  "She agrees. 20 minutes."

Dee sighed but didn't say anything until I hung up the phone.  "Why do you have to go meet a vampire.  You aren't Venatori anymore!"

She pushed away from me and stalked up the stairs.

"Dee, come on.  I haven't seen Ant in months.  I've not see Darwynn save for family get togethers, and mostly because you like him.  And I see Adrian and Danny because I have wolves in my household."

Dee kept walking in her three inch heels through the chilled weather.  Now that the sun was gone it was brisk outside.  "Dee stop."

She kept on walking, "Go see your vampire friends.  And don't bother coming back to my place afterwards.  You'll see Dev in your fucking dreams."

I sighed and watched Dee walk off.  There was no point in chasing after her, she was pissed.  And Dev was going to give me an ear full later.  I sighed and turned to head for the Night Life building.  I was going to be late but right now I didn't give a fuck.
