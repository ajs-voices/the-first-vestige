**SPOILERS BELOW**

Nox falls into a depression

Cari asks Nox for help dealing with the new world order.

The Old World Enforcer has declared war on the council and humanity.  A new organization - the new world order - is seeking out the extinction of mankind as a raising them as you'd raise livestock. Several canneries have already opened up across Europe and Asia.

Valence (the old world enforcer) teams up with Brandon Holt (Giovanni) and they seek to kill the council and lead the vampires into their rightful place as the highest species on the food chain.

Nox goes with Ant and Cari to the Old World to try and stop Valence and Brandon.

While in the old world Nox witnesses what can truly happen to a child who loses control of his ability. (it's like a bomb going off)

Nox has an encounter with some Old World Venatori that are trying to kill ALL vampires.

He encounters them again and is engulfed in flames (and dies and rises from the ashes)

After Nox is fully healed there is a magical tattoo on his body - everywhere.  Thick vines running everywhere flowers spaced around his body, each flower different - (2 + 1) vampire fangs, (2) wolfsbane, (1) dragon tears, (3) passion flowers, (1) angel orchid, (6) flame lilies.  There are thorns protecting each flower and they bleed when one is hurt or in danger.  The flowers minic the emotions of his connected counterpart.

Meets an 400 year old 8 year old (slightly insane, very childish girl who wants nothing more than to be loved but her hunger and thirst are uncontrollable) - she's been locked away by valence for hundreds of years to be used as a catalyst to destory humanity as we know it. (Morana Balog)

Relationship woes:  There is much fighting when Nox leaves to go hunting everyone thought it was all over.

Sage was going to go with Nox but got pulled away on priority business.

Dev keeps in touch through dreams, but they've not mastered the group dream sessions yet.

Nox calls the boys and Sage as much as he can while away but there is still a heavy lingering pain between them.

The potentinal for someone to seduce Nox is high?  (may be used)

**endings**

As a reward and thank you Ant and Cari give Nox (rent to him for a very small fee) the entire top floor of the Night Life Building.

And because of the number of orphaned vampire children Nox couldn't all take in Ant and Cari open an 'orphanage' in the Night Life building - Nox's first 'business venture'

Happing endings with his little family - bringing home a new child and a new home.

Comes home a 'new man' - because of the intensity of the fire and his 'death' Nox's scars have been erased (as with his tattoos)

While Nox is gone Sage and Dorian unlock the files that Dorian's mother gave him. (use to start the next book)

**possible interactions**

Meet Todd (Dorian's best friend and ex-lover)

Meet Asher

**meanings**

(2 + 1) vampire fangs - Ant, Armande + Morana (vampires)
(2) wolfsbane - Fae and Jo (werewolves)
(1) dragon tears - Drake (dragons)
(3) passion flowers - Sage, Dev & Dee (his loves)
(1) angel orchid - Sterling (nephelim)
(6) flame lilies - Matt, Sam, Emma, Martin, Levi & Jeffery (cesari)
