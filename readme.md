Nox falls into a depression

Cari asks Nox for help dealing with the new world order.

The Old World Enforcer has declared war on the council and humanity.  A new organization - the new world order - is seeking out the extinction of mankind as a raising them as you'd raise livestock. Several canneries have already opened up across Europe and Asia.

Valence (the old world enforcer) teams up with Brandon __ (Giovanni) and they seek to kill the council and lead the vampires into their rightful place as the highest species on the food chain.

Nox goes with Ant and Cari to the Old World to try and stop Valence and Brandon.

While in the old world Nox witnesses what can truly happen to a child who loses control of his ability. (it's like a bomb going off)

Nox has an encounter with some Old World Venatori that are trying to kill ALL vampires.

He encounters them again and is engulfed in flames (and dies and rises from the ashes)

Meets an 400 year old 8 year old (slightly insane, very childish girl who wants nothing more than to be loved but her hunger and thirst are uncontrollable) - she's been locked away by valence for hundreds of years to be used as a catalyst to destory humanity as we know it.

Relationship woes:  There is much fighting when Nox leaves to go hunting everyone thought it was all over.

**endings**

As a reward and thank you Ant and Cari give Nox (rent to him for a very small fee) the entire top floor of the Night Life Building.

And because of the number of orphaned vampire children Nox couldn't all take in Ant and Cari open an 'orphanage' in the Night Life building - Nox's first 'business venture'

Happing endings with his little family - bringing home a new child and a new home.

Comes home a 'new man' - because of the intensity of the fire and his 'death' Nox's scars have been erased (as with his tattoos)

While Nox is gone Sage and Dorian unlock the files that Dorian's mother gave him.
